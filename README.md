# Coding & Cocktails Worksheets

Coding & Cocktails worksheets are written in Markdown and use [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). 

Getting going
1. Install **docsify** npm package globally
2. Run `docsify serve docs`

If "docsify serve docs" does not work and you have Python 3 installed locally, you can manually start a static server by using `cd docs && python -m http.server 3000`, then browsing to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. To view a particular unit, add “/#/<unit_name>” to the URL, as in the example that follows:  http://localhost:3000/#/html/

Overview of files
