Follow the instructions on this page to prepare your workspace.

>[!TIP]
>Open [Slack](http://kcwit.slack.com/) to the **#codingandcocktails** channel. It's a great way to stay in touch with your Coding & Cocktails friends and to ask questions during and after the session. We'll also post updates and tips in Slack if we run in to any stumbling blocks tonight.

## Prerequisites for this session

The SPA sessions are tailored for women who completed a bootcamp and know the fundamentals of web development, and are looking for ways to continue learning and practicing in a group environment.

The SPA sessions require basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CLI commands, Git and developing web applications using node, npm, and an IDE. These concepts are not covered in the presentation or the worksheet.

Additionally, we recommended knowledge of JavaScript ES6 constructs and API fundamentals to get the most out of the sessions.

## Required tools for this session

All of the tools listed below are required.

### Browser

A modern browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html).

### Terminal application

We will use the command line and a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface. Use the terminal application you are most familar with. Some examples of terminal applications include iTerm2 or Terminal for macOS and Cmder or GitBash for Windows OS. You may need your terminal application open for the next few required tools depending on your OS configuration.

### Node & npm

Install or update your version of [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en) to the latest LTS release version or higher.

To see what version of Node is installed, run the following command:

{% codeblock copy %}terminal{% codeblock %}
```sh
node -v
```

To see what version of npm is installed, run the following command:

{% codeblock copy %}terminal{% codeblock %}
```sh
npm -v
```

### Git & GitHub

Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) if you don't already have one.

Install or update your version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to ensure the latest security patches are available.

### IDE

Use your favorite IDE. We recommend [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Install extensions needed for Angular development. We recommend [John Papa's "Angular Essentials"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.angular-essentials) as an all in one extension covering all the needs for an Angular developer.

### Coding & Cocktails Directory

Create a directory on your OS for your Coding & Cocktails coding work.

## Helpful tips as you work through the worksheet

>[!TIP]
>View the worksheet and your IDE in split screen. 
>
>For Windows users, use `windows key` + `left arrow` or `windows` + `right arrow` to resize the application and position to the left or right half of your screen.
>
>For Mac users, hold down the full-screen button in the upper-left corner of a window to shrink and position to the left or right side of the screen. Release the button, then click another window to begin using both windows side by side.

>[!TIP]
>Did you know you can collapse the table of contents for worksheets?
>
>Click on the hamburger menu (:fas fa-bars:) at the top of the page to toggle the table of contents.

>[!TIP]
>Did you know you can perform common tasks such as copy and paste and navigate VS Code using keyboard shortcuts?
>
>When working without a mouse, keyboard shortcuts will be faster than a trackpad. Open the [handy dandy keyboard shortcut reference in a new tab](/spa/references/ ':target=_blank') so you can refer to it easily!
