### Overview

JavaScript is the programming language of the web and is the basis of everything we see on the internet. Or if you're creating a cocktail, JavaScript is the liquor-- the base and foundation of the drink.

In this session, we will become familiar with building blocks for programming such as variables, math and logic operations, and loops. We will interact with the Document Object Model using JavaScript to dynamically change elements on a webpage.

We will be focusing on the latest version of JavaScript, ECMAScript 6, or ES6, for short.

While JavaScript has been around since 1995, it has evolved over the decades since. ECMAScript 6, released in 2015, is the latest such evolution.
