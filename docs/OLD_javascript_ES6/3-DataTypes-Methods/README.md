# Data Types and Methods

In this section, we'll practice defining and calling various types of functions

## Exercises for template Literals. objecst shorthand syntax and new array methods(forEach, map, find, indexOf)
## Maybe have the students rewrite what appears on the list as 
`${name} is from ${city},${country}` for the template literals for a few people
and maybe play around with them, like ${name.toUpperCase()}

For ForEach - like 41 of appFinal

Not sure about the object shorthand. Maybe grab someome from results.js, destructure them like the example from the curriculum?  But what is the value of that?
