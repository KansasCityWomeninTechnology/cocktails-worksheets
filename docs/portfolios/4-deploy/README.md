### Overview

Yay! You have a portfolio website built! There's only one problem:  It's only visible if you "go live" from inside your Codespace.

There's no point in having done all this work if we can't show it off.

There are many ways to put a website out on the internet. Most businesses, large or small, pay for hosting packages with web hosting companies. This generally costs some money, including paying for a domain name and for the hosting services.

Domain names aren't much money, but depending on the host you choose, fees to have your site appear on the internet can add up quickly.

Luckily, GitHub has a **free** way to publish, or deploy, your portfolio site!
