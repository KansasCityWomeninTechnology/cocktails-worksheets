# Data Types and Methods



## In this section, we'll practice working with objects, template literals and array methods


1.  Return to the _utils.js_ file.  In the fetchInitialRecipies() function, rewrite the for loop using forEach();

2. If that works, try rewriting it again using map().

3. In the displayRecipes() function, create template literals in recipeElement.innerHTML for the following:
<p>The name of the recipe</p>
<p> The ingredients of the recipe <i>hint: you will need to add .join</i></p>
<p> The instructions for how to prepare the recipe</p>
