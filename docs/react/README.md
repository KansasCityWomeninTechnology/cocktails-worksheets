### Overview

React is a JavaScript library created by Meta to help developers build user interfaces, especially for websites and web apps.

But let’s break that down:

You know when you visit a website like Instagram or Airbnb, and everything feels smooth — buttons respond instantly, pages load without flashing or restarting, and you can interact with parts of the page (like liking a photo) without reloading the whole thing?
 
That’s often thanks to something like React working behind the scenes.

React lets us build small, reusable pieces of UI (called components) that make up a whole page — kind of like building with LEGO blocks.
