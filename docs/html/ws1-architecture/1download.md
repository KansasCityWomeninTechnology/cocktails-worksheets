1. Create a new folder named "architecture" in your "CodingAndCocktails/session1" folder. We will use this for the front-end architecture portion of the worksheet and will serve as the root directory for your application. You will be moving the unzipped code files into this new "architecture" folder.

   >[!WARNING]If you don't have a "CodingAndCocktails/session1" directory, take a moment to [set up your workspace](/html/setup/?id=setup).
