# Front-End Architecture and HTML
Tonight we cover front-end architecture and HTML basics. 

The combination of these two concepts provides the structure and the bones of a website. Or if you're creating a cocktail, it's the glass that holds your cocktail together.

We’ll put both concepts to use here creating our own web page and begin understanding how to organize your code, HTML structure, as well as becoming more comfortable using an **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**ditor (**IDE**) to write HTML.

Front-end architecture is the organization of code and project files. Though there may be coding standards and practices specific to a team, the goal of good front-end architecture is to provide an efficient workflow that is maintainable throughout the project’s life.

In this section of the worksheet, we will organize files with similar purposes to make it easy to maintain the website.

At the end of this section, you will have a webpage that looks like this:

# Create application folder and download assets
Let's get the files we need so we can practice website asset organization.

[filename](./1download.md ':include')

# Group like files into appropriate directories :id=group
Now we need to group like files so that the website assets are well organized.

[filename](./2organize.md ':include')

# Update references in the HTML file
Let's update references to the assets in _index.html_ by replacing the string `DIR` with the correct path name so that our website displays properly.

[filename](./3references.md ':include')
