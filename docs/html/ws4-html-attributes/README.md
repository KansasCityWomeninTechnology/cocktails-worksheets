# HTML Element Attributes

Our web page is coming together. But web pages have images, input, and links. All these HTML elements use **attributes** for extra metadata it needs to work. 

There's also special tags we can add to make our webpage more searchable by search engines like Google. This practice is called **S**earch **E**ngine **O**ptimization. These tags rely on attributes.

We'll add an image, text input field, links, and to practice using attributes.

# Find and download a fun and exciting image
Websites have eye catching images. Let's find one we like and get it ready to add to our site!

## Add an image
Now it's time to add the image to our website. We get to use our first attributes to provide the info the browser needs to display the image.

[filename](./2image.md ':include')

## Set up an text input element
Some websites have the ability to subscribe to a mailing list. We won't set up the HTML form elements necessary to make it work, but we can practice learning about HTML elements and attributes by setting up a text input element.

## Use `anchor` elements for navigation 
A navbar isn't helpful if it doesn't navigate to the different sections of the webpage. In this section we'll add `anchor` elements to the list of sections in the navbar and make it link their respective section in the webpage. The linked section also needs an attribute for hyperlinks to work.

## Add tags to improve SEO 
Your website is almost done! Now we want to apply concepts we learned about **S**earch **E**ngine **O**ptimization (SEO) to make your web page easier for search engines like Google to index.

# Checkpoint
Compare your _index.html_ against the answer key for your work so far. It might look a little different depending on your spacing and text.
