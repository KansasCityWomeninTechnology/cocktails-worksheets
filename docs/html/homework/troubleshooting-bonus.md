## Troubleshooting Bonus

This exercise only requires one addition. Can you figure out what it is?

1.  Create a new Javascript project in StackBlitz.

> [!TIP]
> If you need a refresher on how to create a new Javascript project in StackBlitz, refer to step #2 in [Create StackBlitz account](../setup/?id=create-stackblitz-account) section.

2.  We don't need line #6 in _index.js_. Let's delete the code.

    {% codeblock copy %}index.js line #6{% codeblock %}

    ```js
    appDiv.innerHTML = `<h1>JS Starter</h1>`;
    ```

3.  Replace code in _index.html_ with the code below.

    {% codeblock copy %}index.html{% codeblock %}

    ```html
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
    		<meta charset="UTF-8">
    		<title>Coding &amp; Cocktails Troubleshooting</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    		<h1>This is my Bonus Exercise</h1>
    		<p>It looks like everything is working ok.</p>
    		<p>But there is  one thing missing.</p
    		<p>Can you figure out what it is?</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

4.  Take a close look at the page structure and see if you can figure out what is missing.
