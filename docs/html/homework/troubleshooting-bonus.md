2.  Paste the following code into the file
```html
<html lang="en">
<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<title>Coding &amp; Cocktails Troubleshooting</title>
</head>
<body>
		<h1>This is my Bonus Exercise</h1>
		<p>It looks like everything is working ok.</p>
		<p>But there is  one thing missing.</p
		<p>Can you figure out what it is?</p>
</body>
</html>
```
