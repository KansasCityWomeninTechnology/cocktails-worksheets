1. Now we want to preview the _index.html_ file in Chrome. Instead of saving and reloading the page like we did earlier, we'll use the VS Code plugin **Live Server**. This extension opens up the web page in your default web browser and reloads the page whenever you save files. In VS Code, start the live server by right clicking on _index.html_ in the **EXPLORER** pane and selecting **Open with Live Server**. A browser tab will open.
   >[!WARNING]
>If you don't have the **Live Server** option, take a moment to [set up your workspace](/setup).

   >[!WARNING]
>If the tab opens in another browser, copy the URL and paste it into a new tab in Chrome. The reload will automatically happen in Chrome.
>
>If you get an access warning, click "Allow" to let **Live Server** serve the application.
>
>If you are borrowing a laptop and get an access warning, please contact a member of the Coding & Cockails leadership team for access.

1. You won't see anything exciting on the page yet, but you should see your title displayed in the page tab.
