# HTML Structure

We explored different components that make up a webpage in the last section. The rest of the worksheet will walk you through creating your own _index.html_ page from the ground up. The _index.html_ file is the main HTML for a web page. HTML is one of the building blocks of a web page. It defines the structure of the page and lays the foundation to then add styles and dynamic content. 

In the HTML section of the worksheet, we will create a webpage together that looks like the picture below.

Most of our work tonight will be inside the `<body></body>` tags.  This is where visible page content goes.
