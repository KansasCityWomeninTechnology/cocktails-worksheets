1. VS Code should open the _index.html_ file for you in the editor.

1. Copy the following code snippet and paste it into your _index.html_ file.

   {% codeblock %}index.html{% codeblock %}
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
      <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8" />
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
         <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
         <title>Document</title>
      </head>
      <body>

      </body>
   </html>
   ```

>Take a look at the spacing in the file. Some tags, such as `head` and `body` indent from their parent tag, `html`. This means they are children of the `html` tag. Can you match up the start and end of the `head`, `body`, and `html` tags?
>
>The `meta` and `title` tags are also children. What tag is `meta` and `title`'s parent? Feel free to grab a mentor to talk out the answers to these questions. They LOVE to help and act as a soundboard!
   
1. Save the file.

1. Cheers! You set up the structural foundation of a web page!
