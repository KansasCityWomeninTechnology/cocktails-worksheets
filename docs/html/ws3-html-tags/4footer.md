1. After the "Contact" section, at the very end of the page but still in the `body`, we want to add a footer. The HTML element for footer is `footer`. Place your cursor after the closing `section` tag for "Contact", press `Enter`, and add the `footer` element.

1. Footers often contain copyright information so try using an [HTML entity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity) to add a copyright symbol. Between the opening and closing `<footer></footer>` tags add the text 

   `&copy; Copyright Your Name 2020`.
