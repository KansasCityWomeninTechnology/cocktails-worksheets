# HTML Body 
The body section of your HTML contains the visible part of your webpage. Let's start building out some content!

# Add headers 
Let's start adding some visual elements to our web page by adding headers.

[filename](./1headers.md ':include')

# Create "About" and "Contact" sections 
Next, we'll want an "About" section and a "Contact" sections and add text. We'll explore using `section` and `p` elements.

[filename](./2sections.md ':include')

# Navigation list of sections 
Most websites have a navigation element with a list of links also called a "navbar". We'll add the links later, but for now, we can create the navbar structure. We have two page sections - About and Contact - so we'll need two navigation list items.

Using list elements is also helpful for accessibility since screenreaders utilize the metadata it provides.

[filename](./3lists.md ':include')

# Add a footer 
We want recognize our work and add a footer with copyright information.

[filename](./4footer.md ':include')

# Inspect HTML in Chrome 
You'll often find yourself needing to look at how your page renders in the browser to troubleshoot issues so let's give that a try.

[filename](./5chrome-dev-tools.md ':include')
