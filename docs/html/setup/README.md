# Setup

Today we will learn what web development is and HTML.

Follow the instructions on this page to prepare your workspace.

> [!TIP]
> Open [Slack](http://kcwit.slack.com/) to the **#codingandcocktails** channel. It's a great way to stay in touch with your Coding & Cocktails friends and to ask questions during and after the session. We'll also post updates and tips in Slack if we run in to any stumbling blocks today.

> [!WARNING]If you are borrowing a laptop, please ask your mentor to explain the tools.

> [!WARNING]
> If you are using a Chromebook, having trouble installing tools, or otherwise need to use a Cloud IDE option, we will use a cloud development environment called [**StackBlitz**](https://stackblitz.com/). In order to use StackBlitz, you will need a GitHub account.
>
> Navigate to GitHub to create a personal account or log in. Feel free to ask your mentor for help! When complete and logged in to GitHub, return here to continue the instructions. You won't install any tools listed on this page, but please read through them so you have context for today's worksheet.

# Required tools for this session

You don't need all the tools for today's session. If you haven't installed all the tools listed in [The Tools](https://bit.ly/CnCTheTools) guide already, use the following list to install only the required tools for the worksheet:

# Create a folder for today's work

Create a folder named "session1" in your "CodingAndCocktails" folder by following the steps below.

1. Open a file explorer and navigate to your home directory.

   > [!TIP]
   > Your home directory is typically `/users/<your user name>` on a Mac or `C:/Users/<your user name>` on a Windows machine.
   >
   > **Windows users**- You can navigate to your home directory by typing `%USERPROFILE%` in the file location bar of File Explorer and pressing `Enter`.

1. Create a folder named "session1".

1. Leave the file explorer open. You'll use it in the next section of the worksheet.

# Helpful tips as you work through the worksheet

> [!TIP]
> View the worksheet and your IDE in split screen.
>
> For Windows users, use `windows key` + `left arrow` or `windows` + `right arrow` to resize the application and position to the left or right half of your screen.
>
> For Mac users, hold down the full-screen button in the upper-left corner of a window to shrink and position to the left or right side of the screen. Release the button, then click another window to begin using both windows side by side.
