# Setup :id=setup

Today we will learn what web development and HTML are.

Follow the instructions on this page to prepare your workspace.

> [!TIP]
> Open [Slack](http://kcwit.slack.com/) to the **#codingandcocktails** channel. It's a great way to stay in touch with your Coding & Cocktails friends and to ask questions during and after the session. We'll also post updates and tips in Slack if we run in to any stumbling blocks today.

> [!WARNING]
> We will use a cloud development environment called **GitHub Codespaces**. In order to use Codespaces, you will need a GitHub account. Codespaces **only** works with Chrome.

> [!WARNING]
>This tutorial was written for use with Google Chrome, not Firefox, Brave, Edge, or Safari, so it is important that you use Google Chrome for today. If you use a different browser, things will not behave as this tutorial expects.

# Create Intro to HTML Codespace :id=create-codespace

We will use GitHub Codespaces for our workshop. GitHub Codespaces is a cloud development environment which means you have an access to your code even if you are not on your own laptop.

1. Navigate to [**GitHub**](https://github.com/login) and log in with your GitHub account.

2. Once you're signed in, navigate to [**the starter code repo**]https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/Coding-and-Cocktails-Intro-to-HTML.

and click the "Use this template" button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.

3. Next, select the "Open in a codespace" option.

4. Now you are ready to write some code! StackBlitz page is split into 3 different sections. On the far left is the project's file structure. The middle section is where you will write your code. The far right section is what your code looks like in a browser. Whenever you make a code change, you will see the change in the browser view as well.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to change the project name, you can do so by clicking the **lock icon** on the top center.

> [!TIP]
> View the worksheet and your IDE in split screen.
>
> If you click the **Close** button on top right, it will close the browser view and you will have a wider code section.
> ![](./images/stackblitz-open-tab.png ":class=image-border")
> If you want to open the browser view in a new tab, click **Open in New Tab**
> You can always have code on one half of the screen and browser in the other half.
>
> If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Mentors are happy to help!

> [!TIP]
> Did you know you can collapse the table of contents for worksheets?
>
> Click on the hamburger menu at the top of the page to toggle the table of contents.

> [!TIP]
> Did you know you can perform common tasks such as copy and paste?
>
> When working without a mouse, keyboard shortcuts will be faster than a trackpad. Open the [handy dandy keyboard shortcut reference in a new tab](/html/references/ ":target=_blank") so you can refer to it easily!
