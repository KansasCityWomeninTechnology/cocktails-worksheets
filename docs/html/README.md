### Overview

Front-end architecture is the organization of code and project files. Though there may be coding standards and practices specific to a team, the goal of good front-end architecture is to provide an efficient workflow that is maintainable throughout the project’s life.

HTML is one of the building blocks of a web page. It defines the structure of the page and lays the foundation to then add styles and dynamic content. 

We’ll put both concepts to use here creating our own web page and begin understanding how to organize your code, HTML structure, as well as becoming more comfortable using an **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**ditor (**IDE**) to write HTML.

The combination of these two concepts provides the structure and the bones of a website. Or if you're creating a cocktail, it's the glass that holds your cocktail together.
